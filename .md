Dear Newtonians, \n
Welcome back to the second issue of the Newtonian Newspaper. \n
\n
Here, we feature some new faces who come to contemplate life’s philosophical questions, teach you how to build a plane and shine a light on the backstage experiences of this year’s Drama On Stage performances. Though this issue has taken on the predecessor’s marks, we have tried our best to curate fresh content in one month. \n
\n
The Newtonian has evolved from a bi-monthly publication schedule to a monthly one because we cannot stand the distance between us and fellow Newtonians during those quiet two months. This way, Newtonians will not have to miss us for long while we are churning out words on our computers. \n
\n
First and foremost, we would like to thank Dr. Teerakiat, the executive board, and the supervisors for their advice and assistance in helping this project come to fruition. Without their help and vision, this newspaper club would only be an amorphous idea. Your increased support for our second issue has given us the motivation to continuously work hard on upcoming events and issues to reach out to all corners of the Newton Sixth Form community. For example, we have now established a writing contest system for junior students to increase their exposure to literature and journalism and evoke their love for writing. \n
\n
We also thank you, readers, for providing us with useful feedback that we have incorporated into our second issue. Your opinions do matter to us, and we aim to improve for the better, and provide you all the best reading experiences. We hope that in this issue you will find more insight, more entertainment and hopefully more joy reading this issue that we have carefully curated for you. \n
