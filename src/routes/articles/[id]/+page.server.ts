    title: "To live is to Suffer",
    content:
      "“Why is life so hard?”, a phrase so common and so cliché to the point it is used sarcastically, and yet the question always seems to make its way into our thoughts, onto books and articles, and slipping off the tips of our tongues in conversations. We imagine a perfect life where everything goes our way and where life is easy to navigate, where we don’t have to go to work or school five times a week. No work, no stress, and no pressure; a peaceful utopia we dream of.However, we often contradict our longing for this ‘perfect life’; it would make more sense to condemn negativity and favor positivity if we want that ideal life, but in reality compliments mean nothing in the face of criticism. Someone else’s problems may just be some juicy gossip for you, and the news rarely mentions anything good but instead focuses on tragedies instead. Our life is surrounded by negativity and suffering and even though we desire a peaceful and happy life, we subconsciously put a spotlight on that negativity. So why, as humans dreaming of happiness, do we gravitate towards negativity?\nIt may be hard to believe that humans inherently need to suffer, especially when our ideal life consists of no suffering, but it is believed by many philosophers that suffering is ingrained into human existence. Although it sounds pessimistic there is no life without suffering, no matter how minor the suffering is. The Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevksy expresses in his novella _Notes from Underground_ this thought, and that progress and development that aims to mitigate suffering on an individual and collective level, merely changes the source of suffering in our lives. For example, the many technological advances humanity has managed to achieve eliminates certain problems in our life and thus makes our life easier, however new problems arise, although easier to handle than problems before the advancement, they are still problems that cause a certain level of suffering.\n\n\nAnd even though our problems are getting less severe and our life is getting easier than it is before, we are never satisfied. Innovation after innovation, update after update, we are always seeking ways to make our lives easier. Of course it is never a bad thing, but when will we ever reach the end? It is as if nothing will ever satisfy human desire and we are forever left in a deficit. Dostoyevsky describes, in the same novella, that even if one were to have all the happiness in the world to the point where they could just “sleep, eat cakes and busy [themself] with the continuation of [their] species”, they would still find a way to ruin it all. To Dostoyevsky, humanity needs to have the little imperfections in life in order to prove that they are “not the keys of a piano” but human, as if it were necessary to prove so in the first place. He believes that humanity needs this sense of self-agency provided by suffering, so even if everyone were living their perfect, happy, and peaceful life, people would still find a way to ruin that life in favor of an imperfect life, and this idea is supported by humanity’s extensive history of violence and conflict.\n\n\nSimilarly, Buddhism also acknowledges that suffering is a fundamental part of human life, however it pinpoints that our extensive desire as human beings is the cause of our suffering. This specifically refers to desiring pleasure, material goods, and immortality, so the solution offered by Buddhism is to stop the longing for things that will ultimately never satisfy you. By doing so, according to Buddhism, it will eliminate suffering. This concept and idea from Buddhism then later influenced German philosopher Arther Schopenhauer, who then influenced another German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzche.\n\nHowever Nietzsche disagreed with Schopenhauer and Buddhism, as he believed that to limit our desires was to live in denial of an innate aspect of human life. Rather, he believed in finding a way to live in harmony with suffering, or to find gratitude for existence. Our happiness and joys are heightened and maybe even defined by overcoming suffering, for example how achieving an easy A* grade would be less satisfying than having an academic comeback, going from B’s and C’s to an A*. By first experiencing something bad, we can fully appreciate the good.\n\nIt is hard to grasp how suffering surrounds our daily life and looms over our minds. Even though the ideal utopia we all dream of seems a little less feasible now, it does not mean happiness is unattainable. No matter our opinions on suffering, happiness, and life, the final goal of all these teachings and theories is to be as happy as one can be. Suffering being an intrinsic part of life does not take away the happiness of life.\n\n ## Sources:\n\n - [The Harder You Try, The Worse It Gets - The Philosophy of Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://youtu.be/F9kfiUhmRO8?si=gnGA5WfF2G6P_Hyt) \n\n - [Schopenhauer vs Nietzsche: The Meaning of Suffering](https://iai.tv/articles/schopenhauer-vs-nietzsche-the-meaning-of-suffering-auid-1801) \n\n - [PBS Report on Buddhism](https://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htm)",

    title: "The Newton Musical: Technical Director",
    content:
      "As you all may have heard, the 1st showcase of _the Newton Musical_ has already passed! In my opinion, I’m proud to say it was much of a success.  But now, I’ll let you into a world people don’t normally talk about, to the world many may want to hide. Welcome to the backstage.\n\nTo begin with, I doubt you even know what a technical director is— some of you probably don't even know this job exists. But don’t worry, I’m here to tell you all about my role and my experiences in this production. A definition from _Berklee College of Music_ states “a Technical director is responsible for operating, protecting, and maintaining the theatre's technical assets, while also managing and overseeing the different technical departments, including set, lighting, costumes, props, sound, and effects.”\n\nFrom the start of our production, I began searching for a suitable spot to showcase our musicals. It was tough, as we have little to no budget. We had to consider many aspects of a particular location before we could settle with one. I started wandering around the school, trying my best to find a perfect spot. It took me some time until I came across the school’s auditorium on the 11th floor. It was a normal  afternoon, when the sun didn't shine in through the windows, that millions of stage design ideas started rushing through my mind. At that very moment, I knew it was the perfect place for the show. I could imagine our actors walking up and down the auditorium, adding levels of depth to the visual aspect of the play. When I pictured the actors singing and dancing before me, I was certain our musical would be showcased here.\n\nAfter deciding on the location, I started to look into lighting. As our creative drama supervisors have said many times, “Use what we have to its fullest potential first.” so I tried experimenting with the school auditorium’s down light and stage light, and I found out that they were usable. Along with P’Oam’s help, I was able to come up with a lighting chart (basically a lighting design plan but documented). However, there was one issue that I couldn’t  disregard— the actors’ faces. They were dark. They were so dark, I was hardly able to see their facial expressions. I tried to make the actors stand adjacent to the light, but that shifted the mood we were trying to convey. Though, it all worked out in the end, all thanks to our creative drama master, P’Joob. He brought a team of light and design students from OpenSchool to help us operate the led light that serves a purpose of shining into the actors’ faces. Finally, their faces and expressions could be seen.\n\nIn an effort to ensure that everyone in the audience gets to enjoy the show, regardless of how far back they are, we used two particular tools: the platforms and the TV. We predicted that those in the front row would block those in the back, so we elevated the stage to make it easier for the audience in the rear zone to watch the show. But that wouldn’t be enough to give them the greatest experience possible, so we added a live TV in zones C and D to help the audience in those zones to watch the show and not simply see the heads and shoulders of people sitting  in front of them.\n\nNow, everyone could see the actors, but how about hearing them clearly? Actors projecting their voices wouldn’t be enough to reach everyone sitting in a long, weird shaped chamber, especially on top of the fact that the room doesn’t support nor promote the echoing of voices at all. So, we decided to mic the casts. Though, due to lack of communication on my side, we experienced certain difficulties. We didn’t get to do a runthrough  with the mics before the real show. For some actors, it was their first time using a mic on the real stage, and with that comes problems. Since some mics weren’t tested beforehand,  they malfunctioned on the stage, leaving those in the audience confused. It was during this one sentence that the mic suddenly didn’t pick up. It was the sentence that revealed  the death of Connor Murphy. Since this was one of the main points of the plot, some people were left confused throughout the entire show. Luckily, we were able to troubleshoot the problem during showtime and so we fixed the mics in time.\n\nIn the category of sound control, we mustn’t forget music. Needless  to say, I didn’t need to worry much about that department thanks to P’Oam, our music director. Although, it is indeed my job to deal with how the instruments will connect to the main mixer, the volume of the music being played, and how much space the band will take. At  first I thought that venue planning wouldn’t be hard, but after I started it, I soon realised that this was not the case. I had to ask myself many questions along the line of “How much space will this take?”, “How much space will that take?”', or “How many seats can we fit into the chamber?”. In no time, I came up with a proper floor plan.\n\nOther aspects of technical design include props, costumes and queues. For props and costumes, the musical directors had a meeting with our props and costume designer, P’Mimi. She was brilliant, as she was able to come up with a design for props and costumes for each and every scene in just a couple of days. For the queues, P’Oam and I created a technique chart in which we documented the actions that should occur in the settings after certain actions are carried out by the actors.\n\nI have to thank each and every person in the Newton Musical Team for contributing to  this project; thanks to E-Studio for helping us out with sound control; thanks to OpenSchool for the light control; thanks to all of our creative drama supervisors for helping and supporting us throughout journey, we wouldn’t have been  able to come this far without you; and lastly, thanks to the executive teams for supporting us. Without any one of you, the show wouldn't be where it is today. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMe.\n\n_(Technical Director of the Newton Musical)_\n\n\n",
